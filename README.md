# HyWaMoRe
## Parse Hyrule Warriors models and export them to other 3D formats.

### Requirements

* Otherwise, Linux and FreeBSD should have no issues. Install regular build-essential packages (gcc/clang and friends).

### Features
* Parse models into structures that can be used for alternative converters
* Extract Mesh data
* Convert to Wavefront .obj file

### Future
* Reverse engineer bone structure and textures
* Animations, maybe
